# Bayesian-Classifier
Pattern Recognition 
OBJECTIVE
    To design and test a Bayesian classifier which minimizes classification error.
INPUT DATA
    The data to be used for training (H) the classifier is given in the file TRAINING DATA.
    The data to be used for testing (T) the classifier is given in the file TEST DATA.
DESCRIPTION
    This is a c = 3 class problem. Both the training data and test data consists of 15,000 d = 4 dimensional vectors in physical coordinates, with one feature vector (transposed) per line. The first 5000 samples in TRAINING DATA correspond to class 1 (C1), the second 5000 samples correspond to class 2 (C2) and the third 5000 samples correspond to class 3 (C3). Using the training data, the objective is to train and determine the class for each sample using a Bayesian classifier design and then use the classifier to classify the test data.
The probability of error and the confusion matrix for both the classified data are also to be determined.
